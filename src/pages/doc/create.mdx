# Create your own components

<div class="typo-lead">
  **Lotsof** components system is made to be extensible and allow you to add
  your own components to the library.
</div>

## Repository

To make use of your own components, you simply have to create a **publicly accessible git repository** with your components in it like so:

```bash
└── src
  └── components
    └── myComponent
      └── component.json
      └── myComponent.js
      └── myComponent.css
    └── otherComponent
      └── component.json
      └── otherComponent.js
```

## Component.json

The _component.json_ files are required to describe your component like so:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "helloWorld",
  "description": "Simple hello world component to test the component system",
  "dependencies": {
    "@lotsof/components/config": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Lotsof.json

Last but not least, you can add your components library to your project by creating the `lotsof.json` file in the root of your project like so:

```json
{
  "components": {
    "sources": {
      "myComponentsLibrary": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://your-git-service.com/your-components-library.git"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating library

Once you have setted your components library in your `lotsof.json` file, you can simply run the following command to update your library:

```bash
lotsof components.update
```

This will update your local component libraty with the latest version of your components library. You can now list the available components with the `lotsof components.ls` command.

> Note that updating the library will not update the components in your project.
