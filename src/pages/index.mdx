<div class="typo-lead">
  _Components_ are **small prebuild pieces** that you can add in your project
  and use as is or customize to fit your needs. It's kind of the
  "**scaffolder**" of your project that let you add some prebuild pieces to it.
  _The difference with a package manager_ is that you can **customize these
  components** to fit your needs.
</div>

Lotsof components are built around some principles that make them **easy to use** and **customizabel**. You can
add some components from the **Lotsof** components library as well as use your own.

## The **lotsof** CLI

First you need to install the **lotsof** CLI globally like so:

```bash
npm i @lotsof/cli -g
```

Run the following command to ensure that the CLI has been well installed:

```bash
lotsof --version
```

## List available components

To list all the available components in the library, simply run the following command:

```bash
lotsof components.ls
```

## Add you first component

To add your first component, simply run the following command:

```bash
lotsof components.add @lotsof/components/helloWorld
```

This command will add the `helloWorld` component to your project under `src/components/helloWorld`.

## Create your own components

To create your own components, simply follow the linked documentation:

<a

  href="/doc/create"
  title="Lotsof | Components | Create your own component"
>
  Create your own component
</a>
